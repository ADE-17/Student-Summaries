0,"One main element of an ideal tragedy is that of a single unified plot.  This means that the story follows the actions and resolution of the main character only, and focuses on the character's change of fortune froom good to bad. Another element most crucial to a tragedy is that the plot must incite both fear and pity for all who watch the play. If the play ends with a ""feel good"" moment, then it has failed as a tragedy, as it doesn't incite fear and pity. The purpose of tragedy is not to  satisfy some moral sense, but to inspire feelings appropriate to witnessing a tragedy, to experience a ""cleansing"" of watching someone else suffer.  Lastly, an ideal tragedy must have a protagonist that is not overly righteous or holy, but is not depraved; the character is somewhat middle of the road.  By having the character behave in this way it makes the story more realistic and true, making the character's journey that much more engaging for the audience.  When the audience sees a tragic event occur to a plausible character because of a mistake or slight misfortune, the feeling of tragedy is heightened because it seems more true.",3.34823182563613,3.51775345440415,7,21,28,2

The very top of the pyramid was the gods and the pharaohs because the gods controlled the universe and because the pharaohs were believed to be able to comunicate with the gods so they were thought as god like. The gods controlled the universe and the pharaohs controlled everyone. The priest and nobles were next. Only nobles could hold government office. The priest were supposed to make the gods happy. After nobles and priest came the soldiers. The soldiers were the ones that fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings. Soldiers were also the ones who supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved in building such structures as pyramids and palaces. The people who were next after soilders were scribes. A scribe recorded in writing the everyday life and extraordinary happenings in ancient Egypt. Their jobs were varied and included writing letters for fellow villagers who couldn't write, recording the amount of crops harvested. After the scribes came the merchants. Egyptian merchants carried products such as gold, papyrus made into writing paper or twisted into rope, linen cloth, and jewelry to other countries. Next after merchants were artisans. Artisans created the fine artwork that often covered temples, royal tombs, and other monuments. They worked in large groups to complete engravings, paintings, and hieroglyphics. Despite artisans' skill and creativity, the upper classes often viewed them as little more than common laborers. Next after artisans were farmers. Now we're on to the lower part of the pyrimad with farmers. Farmers are the ones who harvest food. They also harvest papyrus for others(most likely scribes) to write on. Now we're on the VERY bottom of the social pyrimad with slaves and servants. The servants worked as cooks, butlers, litter carriers, and as pharaoh's dressers. The male servants also worked on royal building projects or were sent to fight in the Egyptian army. Egyptian servants did not have many rights but were usually not treated poorly. Egyptian servants could not own or inherit land. Slaves were very important in ancient Egypt as a big part of the labor force, but they were also used for many other purposes. Many slaves were house servants, gardeners, farm labor, musicians and dancers of excellent talent, scribes, and accountants.",3.80272207089915,3.51483103434524,13,54,167,12

The entire point of tragedy is to invoke a deep and true feeling of pity or sadness in the reader, something they can relate to on some level. a man going from rich to poor does not invoke these feelings, and neither does a man going from rags to riches. Villians falling and heroes rising cause opposite emotions than what is to be striven for in a tragedy, so a true tragedy has to have a merely ok character, usually with a moral compass that is skewed.

Aristotle also writes ""...a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about...by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned..."" This proves that Aristotle believes that the main character of a great tragedy must be a man who is neither good nor evil, but somewhere in between; and that that man must be prosperous or renowned.

Therefore, if a tragedy were to display a man such as one described above, and have a random, unforeseen misfortune befall him, the audiences would easily be able to relate.

0,Aristotle believed tragedies should follow a complex manner in regards to causing emotions of fear and commotion from the audience. In order to accomplish this tragedy the plot must be constructed in a unified way that tells a single and understandable narrative. The tragedy should feature a character neither good or bad whose misfortune causes a tragic and dramatic ending brought about by some error or frailty that led to their own downfall.,0.761699361678808,1.00236129191155,0,3,6,1
2,"The Third Wave developed over such a short period of time because of how seriously the students reacted to the regime of the Third Wave. After the reading explains what rules were outlined to students, the text states, ""As the week went on, Jones’ class transformed into a group with a supreme sense of discipline and community.  [...] This resulted in dramatic improvements to the efficiency, or orderliness, of the class. [...] After only three days, the experiment took on a life of its own, with students from all over the school joining in. The class expanded from initial 30 students to 43 attendees"" (CommonLit). This cluster of text qoutes shows how legitamately the student took directions because the students did not even hesitate to follow orders nor did they question the ethics of some of the rules. For example, not a single student questioned the morals of the salute when it was purposefully intended to resemble that of the Nazi regime's salute. This not only proves how naive minor's can be to their superiors but also demonstrates how quickly society can follow one another when the majority is commiting said action. This is the classic case that everyone and their neighboor's mom told you as a kid: ""If your friend jumped off a bridge would you jump too?""- in this case and many, yes, you would be more likely to commit an action, even if it may be questionable, if your peers are also participating in the action. This fact connects back not only many examples throughout human history but in varying life forms across the globe. Birds for example learn to fly, walk, eat, etc. by watching their siblings and following the mother. It is human nature to follow the pack and unfortunately it is not always a benefit to society.
