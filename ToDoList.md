1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Review the competition details, data description, and evaluation metrics together.
   - Discuss the main challenges you anticipate, given the problem definition.

2. **Data Exploration:**
   - Conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the nature of the data. This includes:
     * Distribution of grades (3-12).
     * Checking for any missing values or anomalies.
     * Analyzing the distribution of content and wording scores.
     * Investigating if there are any patterns based on prompts.
   - Discuss findings and insights from the EDA.

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values, if any.
   - Tokenize and preprocess the text summaries.
   - Decide on a strategy to embed or vectorize the text data.
   - Split the training data for validation purposes.

4. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Explore potential features from the text, such as summary length, unique word count, etc.
   - Analyze prompt texts to see if they can offer additional features.
   - Discuss and implement feature extraction methods together.

5. **Modeling Strategy:**
   - Since there are two target variables (content and wording scores), discuss whether you want to use a multi-task learning model or separate models for each target.
   - Begin with a baseline model (e.g., Linear Regression) to set a performance benchmark.
   - Explore more complex models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks.

6. **Model Training:**
   - Divide tasks: One person can focus on hyperparameter tuning while the other can focus on model architecture, for example.
   - Regularly compare models using a consistent validation set.

7. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Use the validation set to evaluate model performance.
   - Decide on evaluation metrics (as per the competition's requirement) and ensure you both understand them.

8. **Submission Strategy:**
   - Make regular submissions to understand the model's performance on the public leaderboard.
   - Discuss and plan ensemble methods or stacking if individual models show promise.

9. **Communication and Collaboration:**
   - Schedule regular meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and next steps.
   - Use version control (e.g., Git) to manage code. Platforms like GitHub or GitLab can be useful for collaborative projects.
   - Document everything, including code, insights, and modeling decisions. Jupyter notebooks can be valuable for this.

10. **Feedback Loop:**
   - After each major iteration (e.g., new feature engineering technique, new model architecture), evaluate the results and decide on the next steps.

11. **Final Submission:**
   - Ensure that the submission adheres to the format specified in `sample_submission.csv`.
   - Double-check the processing steps to make sure the pipeline works for the test data.

12. **Post-Competition Reflection:**
   - After the competition ends, discuss the results, what went well, what could've been improved, and lessons learned.
